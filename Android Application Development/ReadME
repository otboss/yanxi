Android Application Development - How to tweak it to make it your own app

Week 1 - BeatBox Application: Change background music, use either the seekbar or menu to change speed (not both), change the video media, can remove custom controls.
Week 2 - Themes: Change the colors
Week 3 - NerdLauncher: Change the background image (can make a theme), change the sound that plays when an app is launched, change span  of grid
Week 4 - TaskGetter: Use your own server(refer to web-dev ex.2/3) and create custom tasks to display on the app. Note that you will have to set your server to 
public (ipaddress:0.0.0.0) and change the url in the fetchItems() function inside the TaskFetcher class for it to connect with your server.
